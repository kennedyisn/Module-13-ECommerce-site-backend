# Module-13-ECommerce-site-backend

## Description

Seeing that e-commerce is one of the quickest growing industry sectors in the world it is crucial to create an effective backend for these shopping sites to ensure we are saving important data. This project was created to help me get familiar with doing just that as there are a plethora of roles with the intention of creating strong backends to better track user data and give business executives the most useful information possible when making decisions.
